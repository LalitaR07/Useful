If you prefer not to enter your credentials every time, you can set up SSH authentication. Here's a brief overview:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Generate SSH key:
    
        Open terminal or command prompt.
        Use the following command to generate an SSH key pair:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

    Follow the prompts to save the SSH key in the default location or specify a custom location.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Add SSH key to GitHub:

    Copy the contents of the public key (typically found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub).  
    (cd ~/.ssh  then ls  then gedit id_rsa.pub)
    Go to your GitHub account settings.
    Navigate to "SSH and GPG keys".
    Click on "New SSH key" and paste your public key.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Use SSH URL for Git operations:

    Instead of using the HTTPS URL, use the SSH URL when cloning or configuring your Git repository.
    For example:
    
    git clone git@github.com:UserName/myproject.git

By following either of these methods, you should be able to authenticate with GitHub successfully.
